super glad you're interested in working with we and helping to create conversations that matter and build the organizations that are worth showing up to I actually just finished talking with Tiffany hello Tiffany during an exit interview so the last time that will formally talk as a part of Tiffany's internship as the social media scientist of we and one of the questions that we always at the last question knowing that we're passionate about questions the last question that we always like to ask is how can I how can you get your next dream job or dream thing so Tiffany I just had that conversation but I want to ask now Tiffany thinking about your time working with me or last year what is one of the most valuable things that you feel like you're taking away into your next job and life was before I started this internship I don't want to say it was closed but a year later period in general just knowing how to communicate with other people and just having an open social entrepreneurial mindset so you're saying if you apply to work with you that you need to buy a helmet cuz you might have your mind that's a promise that I feel I know I feel comfortable making if we choose to work together at the end of working together you won't be the exact same person and neither will I and neither will and so anyway I hope you're looking forward to connecting thanks so much for being dedicated to creating conversations that matter
