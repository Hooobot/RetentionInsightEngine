Good afternoon, thanks for coming in today. We appreciate you taking the time for this exit interview. Let's start with why you decided to leave the company?

Good afternoon. I'm glad to have this discussion. I'm leaving mainly because I found an opportunity that better aligns with my career aspirations in a more specialized field that isn’t available here.

That makes sense. What did you appreciate most during your time with us?

I really appreciated the team environment and the support from my colleagues. It was great how everyone was eager to help each other and how management was accessible.

It’s good to hear that. Were there areas you felt could be improved during your tenure here?

Yes, I think the opportunities for professional growth could be enhanced. More training programs or clear career progression guidelines would have been helpful.

Thank you for that feedback. How did you perceive the management and their approach?

The management style was generally supportive, but I would have benefited from more regular feedback on my performance rather than waiting for annual review periods.

That’s an important point, and we're looking at ways to improve continuous feedback. Do you have any suggestions for us as you move on?

Perhaps a focus on maintaining a balanced workload could be useful. There were times when the workload was intense, and it might help with employee retention if there was more emphasis on maintaining balance.

We take note of that, and we will discuss it further internally. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?

Just that I’ve valued my time here and learned a lot. Thanks for the opportunity to express my thoughts today.

Thank you for your candid feedback and for your contributions to the team. We wish you the best in your future endeavors.

Thank you, I've appreciated my time here and hope to stay in touch.
