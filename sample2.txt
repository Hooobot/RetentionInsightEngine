Good afternoon and thank you for joining this exit interview. We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback. To begin, could you share your reasons for deciding to leave the company? The main reason I'm leaving is to pursue a career opportunity that is more in line with my future goals in environmental sustainability, which unfortunately, I felt I couldn't fully achieve in my current role. We're sorry to hear that, but we understand. Moving on, what aspects of your job here did you find most rewarding? I really valued the collaborative culture and the freedom I had to initiate projects. This environment made it enjoyable to come to work every day. That's wonderful to hear. On the flip side, were there aspects of your job or our company that you felt needed improvement? Yes, one area that could be improved is the response time to internal requests. Sometimes, the delays in decision-making affected our ability to meet project deadlines efficiently. We appreciate that input; it's something we can look at improving. How did you find the support from management during your time with us? Generally, the support was good, but there were occasions where I felt more direct communication regarding company changes would have been beneficial. It's valuable to hear you felt that way, and we will take that into consideration. Before we conclude, are there any other comments or suggestions you would like to leave us with? I would suggest perhaps focusing more on employee wellness programs. Investing more in employee well-being can really enhance productivity and job satisfaction. Thank you for those insights. We'll definitely consider your suggestions as we strive to improve our workplace. We wish you the best in your future endeavors and hope you achieve great success in your new role. Thanks again for the opportunity to work here, I've gained a lot of valuable experience and I hope we can keep in touch.
